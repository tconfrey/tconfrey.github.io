title: A Blog?
---

I'm not sure about public online presence beyond my LinkedIn profile and my Instagram feed. I'm comfortable with those being views onto my life and work that are visible to the world. In my TextTelevision days I maintained a Wordpress blog and then a Tumblr site. Personally I liked Googles Plus with its notion of circles of sharing - as an aside, seems very much the direction FB is moving these days w Groups - but its gone now. I did download and archive my feed <here>.

One of my projects for my "sabbatical" is to clean up my own knowledge management tools. I'm always looking for ways to organize information to compensate for my lacking memory, with the result that I never stick to any one way 


Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.

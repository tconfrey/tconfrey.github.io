title: A Blog?
---

I'm not sure about public online presence beyond my LinkedIn profile, my Github repo and my Instagram feed. I'm comfortable with those being views onto my life and work that are visible to the world. In my TextTelevision days I maintained a Wordpress blog and then a [Tumblr](http://https://tconfrey.tumblr.com/) site. Personally I liked Googles Plus with its notion of circles of sharing - as an aside, seems very much the direction FB is moving these days w Groups - but its gone now. I did download and archive my feed <here>.

One of my current projects is to clean up my own knowledge management tools. I'm always looking for ways to organize information to compensate for my incomplete memory but have never stumbled upon the ideal tool. So like all good software developers I decided to build my own. Its a mere shadow of what it could be and not yet ready for any kind of primetime but I'm pretty pleased with how [BrainTool](http://braintool.com) is turning out,
